                <p>Ferroptosis, a type of programmed cell death triggered by metabolic imbalance and manifested by lipid
                peroxide
                overproduction has recently emerged as a therapy option for cancer. Many cancer cells already acquire
                ferroptotic
                features such as overproduction of lipid and ROS, but are "saved" by the expression of ferroptosis
                suppressors. They are
                thus particularly sensitive to inducers that activate ferroptosis driver or repress ferroptosis
                suppressors. We have
                been interested in the studies of transcriptional controls of these drivers and suppressors in prostate
                cancer cells.
                Prostate cancer cells are highly lipogenic and glycolytic, with innate ability to de novo synthesize
                lipid and
                cholesterol. Despite the abundance of lipid, the therapy resistant prostate cancer cells often evolve
                mechanisms to
                suppress ferroptosis. We have recently identified metabolic modulation which induces ferroptosis in
                therapy resistant
                cells, thereby overcoming resistance. The transcription factors which are downstream effectors of these
                metabolites are
                also identified. These transcription factors are part of super enhancer complexes which dictate the
                expression of
                ferroptosis genes and are potential targets for therapy. These results will be discussed in the
                presentation.</p>
